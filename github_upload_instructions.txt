# After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands:

# Change the main branch name to 'main' (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Add the remote GitHub repository URL (replace with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/temamumtaza/MimicTheEmoji.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# If you're prompted for GitHub credentials, you'll need to:
# 1. Create a personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Use that token as your password when prompted

# Note: If you prefer to use SSH instead of HTTPS, use this command instead:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:temamumtaza/MimicTheEmoji.git
